# Command Line


## Getting out of trouble



- Remember to `ctrl` + `C`
- Use **man** + **name of command here**, man will provide a description as to what the command does. Sometimes it won't make much sense but hey, the more you know


## Terminal Shortcuts

- `control` + `A` Jump to beginning
- `control` + `E` Jump to end
- `control` + `U` Deletes everyone


## Commands

- echo:  write arguments to the standard output
- man: Stands for manual, provides description of a command and much more! Do `man` + `man` to find out
- clear or `control` + `L`: clears the terminal
- exit or `control` + `D`: exits the terminal


## Random

- Tying in yes in the terminal is interesting.
